# **Don't Fall!**

Welcome to **Don't Fall!**, the infinity jumper game where you jump from platform to platform, trying not to fall into the lava below! The more you jump, the higher you go, and the longer you last, the higher your score!

This game was a passion project created in **6 hours**. I was **struggling** a bit with the platform spawner but it was all worth it. I hope you have fun playing it!

## **Gameplay**

In **Don't Fall!**, your goal is simple:
- **Jump** from platform to platform.
- **Avoid falling** into the lava.
- Keep going higher and higher to increase your score.

The platforms spawn randomly, and you'll need quick reflexes to jump on them and avoid the deadly lava below.
